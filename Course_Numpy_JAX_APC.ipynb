        "The Numpy array model is quite powerful, but before delving into the details on how Numpy arrays can be manipulated, it is interesting to understand why they are much more efficient than Python lists. First, when a Numpy array is created, its elements are stored one next to the other (the memory storage is contiguous, see figure on the left for a 2-dimensional array), whereas in a Python list, elements are created before the list and they can be stored wherever in the memory (the memory storage is scattered, see figure on the right). In most systems, data from the main memory is transferred to the CPU via layers of caches, which implies that memory transfers from the cache to the CPU involve whole chunks of contiguous memory (a cache line) even if only few bytes in the cache line are actually requested by the CPU. As a consequence, a non-contiguous memory storage of the data will force the transfer of unneeded data from the cache and will incur a bandwidth penalty. In addition to that, modern architectures also have the possibility to anticipate transfers from the memory by prefetching the next cache lines. This mechanism will obviously better work when the data storage is contiguous. A second advantage of Numpy’s arrays over Python’s lists is that all elements occupy the same number of bytes, and as a consequence, the location of an element in the memory (its address) can be cheaply computed from its index and the location of the first element. There is no such relationship in Python lists: the location of each element has to be stored in the memory, so that every read or write access has the indirection overhead of transferring this element location to the CPU beforehand.\n",
